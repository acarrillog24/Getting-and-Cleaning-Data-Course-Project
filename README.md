CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up and tyding up the data

Analysis.R performs the data preparation followed by the 5 steps described in the course projectâ€™s assignment:
  1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2 )Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
Final.txt is the final outcome after having followed all the steps mentioned above.
